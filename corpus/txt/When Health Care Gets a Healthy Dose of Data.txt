February 2015 when Intermountain Healthcare would switch on its new electronic health records
(EHR) system in two of its 22 hospitals and 24 of its 185 clinics.
Pierce was hardly the only health care executive concerned about a major EHR installation.
Indeed, a year earlier, a key provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 20091
went into effect, mandating that all health care providers adopt and demonstrate “meaningful
use” of EHR systems to maintain their Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement levels.2 But while
others scrambled to meet the deadline, Intermountain executives were thinking past it — because
Intermountain was replacing an EHR system, not installing its first one.
In fact, Intermountain had created its own EHR system in the 1970s, helping the not-for-profit hos-
pital develop a reputation as an innovator in evidence-based medicine. But that system had aged: It

word processing, managers spent more time typing
than they had before.Yet going back to typing pools
seems absurd now. I expect many of the changes
induced by EHR will seem similarly absurd to return
to. And the first generations of these systems will be
clunkier than later generations. Unfortunately, these
clunkier steps are largely inevitable on the path to-
ward benefits from EHR systems and analytics.

Intermountain provides a nice example of many suc-
cesses from embracing analytics, both historically
and with their current initiatives. But even with this
rich history, it will continue to have to work through
many issues when it comes to deriving value from
data. From that perspective, Intermountain’s story
should be a cautionary tale for those looking to em-
ulate it. Less analytically mature organizations will
find it tough to have only the difficulties Intermoun-
tain has had and can realistically expect more.

Despite the effort required, organizations every-
where (in health care and beyond) need to improve
their ability to build value through data.
